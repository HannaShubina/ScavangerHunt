    <h1>Scavenger Hunt Rules</h1>
   
   <div class="rules">
       <div class="rule">
        <h3>1. Objective:</h3>
        <p>The goal of the scavenger hunt is to reach a specific location within the given time limit.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>2. Location Recognition:</h3>
        <p>Locations can be identified by their descriptions. If you require additional details, you can press the "Hint" button, which will provide extra information but will also deduct 3 minutes from your remaining time.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>3. Location Confirmation:</h3>
        <p>Upon arriving at a location, press the "Share Location" button. The system will verify your location and either approve or reject your request. If correct, the system will provide the next clue.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>4. Time Limit:</h3>
        <p>If a task is not completed within the allotted time, the scavenger hunt will end.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>5. Flexible Location:</h3>
        <p>It's not necessary to be at an exact point, as the program operates within a certain radius.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>6. Reward System:</h3>
        <p>For each completed task, participants will receive virtual currency called "pebbles." The amount of pebbles earned depends on how quickly the task is finished. For every minute saved, participants earn 10 pebbles (e.g., if you have 15 minutes remaining, you'll earn 150 pebbles). Later, participants can exchange their pebbles for real awards in the "Pebbles" tab.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>7. Support:</h3>
        <p>Should you encounter any difficulties during the hunt, please don't hesitate to contact us for assistance.</p>
    </div>
   
    <div class="rule">
        <h3>8. Reporting Errors:</h3>
        <p>If you believe there is an error in the program, please take a screenshot and notify us immediately. If you encounter a discrepancy between your location and the program's verification, please record a video and send it to us. In the event of an error, you will receive compensation, and your next hunt will be free of charge.</p>
